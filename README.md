# Random Password Generator

## Description
I built this to generate a password based on user selected criteria. such as, uppercase, lowercase, numeric and or special characters. I wrote the code to kick back an empty return if the user doesn't select at least one type of character. I learned a new way to prompt users for input and how to compare it to the required inputs. I also learned how to set a "window" for how many options the user has to choose (ie 0-128)
